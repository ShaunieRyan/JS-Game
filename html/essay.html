                <h2>JS Game – HTML</h2>
                <h3>Shauna Ryan GF 2021</h3>
                <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for documents designed for the intent to be displayed in a web browser. It was first created in the early 90s, by Tim Berners-Lee. Throughout the years there may have many different versions created. Two of the most common types are HTML 4.01 and XHTML. Majority of web pages that are around today were built by using either of these. It is a platform-independent language. This means that it can be used in any platform. These include Windows and Linux.</p>
                
                <p>It wasn’t until HTML3 that there became a massive increase in users of HTML. This was due to more powerful characteristics for “webmasters” in designing websites. Unfortunately, these features slowed down the browser in applying further improvements. HTML5 is the newest version of HTML. This compared to other types of HTML was created to become backwards compatible with current web browsers. Its purpose is to build new features onto existing features so that older browsers have fallback content. Many other HTML languages struggle to be as backwards compatible as HTML5. It supports SVG, canvas and other virtual vector graphics. While with HTML you could only use virtual graphics in conjunction with different technologies such as Flash.</p>

                <p>When it comes to HTMLs, there are both many advantages and disadvantages. One great advantage of HTML is that it is widely used. This means that if you decide to work with it, you can basically use it anywhere you, please without coming across any issues. Since it is so widely used, HTML language is supported on every browser meaning that if you change your mind as to which to use it will still work perfectly on the other. This also means that there are no extra purchases needed to be made when using HTML as it is a default on every browser. It is easy to learn and use, meaning that you don’t need to be as highly skilled to be able to use it compared to others.</p>
                
                <p>Although HTML may seem great, there are a few disadvantages to using it. One of which is that the security features on it are not great. Making it not the safest for those wanting to have more privacy and protection online. It requires a lot of code writing to make even the simplest of webpages making it not so great to use for some. HTML does not create dynamic pages, only static and plain. Making it quite useless for someone who needs dynamic pages. Lastly, when it comes to writing longer code when making a webpage, using HTML makes it quite complex compared to when shorter code is used.</p>
